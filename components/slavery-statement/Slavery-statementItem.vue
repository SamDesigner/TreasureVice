                <li>
                    Modern slavery blights our society and harms people all over the world. Slavery continues today in every country in the world. Women forced into prostitution. 
                    People were forced to work in agriculture, domestic work, and factories.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights. It takes various forms, such as slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour and human trafficking, all of which have in common the deprivation of a person’s liberty by another in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain. The Company has a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery, and we are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business dealings and relationships and to implementing
                    and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure modern slavery is not taking place anywhere in our own business or in any of our supply chains.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Someone is in slavery if they are:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc">
                <li>forced to work – through coercion, or mental or physical threat.</li>
                <li>owned or controlled by an ’employer’, through mental or physical abuse or the threat of abuse.</li>
                <li>dehumanized, treated as a commodity or bought and sold as ‘property’;</li>
                <li>physically constrained or have restrictions placed on their freedom of movement.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                Human trafficking involves recruitment, harbouring or transporting people into a situation of exploitation using violence, deception or coercion and being forced to work against their will.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many people who fall, a victim of trafficking, want to escape poverty, improve their lives, and support their families. Often they get an offer of a well-paid job abroad or in another region. Often they borrow money from their traffickers in advance to pay for arranging the job, travel and accommodation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The social care sector is a large employer of people from abroad and we need to take whatever measures are necessary to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking.
            </p>
            <p>
                Policy
            </p>
            <p>
                We are committed to driving out modern slavery and human trafficking within our service and those companies who supply us with goods and services whenever it becomes known to us.
            </p>
            <p>
                
                The Company has a zero-tolerance approach to modern slavery, and we are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business dealings and relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure modern slavery is not taking place anywhere in our own business or in any of our supply chains.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are also committed to ensuring there is transparency in our own business and in our approach to tackling modern slavery throughout our supply chains, consistent with our disclosure obligations under the Modern Slavery Act 2015. We expect the same high standards from all of our contractors, suppliers and other business partners, and as part of our contracting processes, in the coming year we will include specific prohibitions against the use of forced, compulsory or trafficked labour, or anyone held in slavery or servitude, whether adults or children, and we expect that our suppliers will hold their own suppliers to the same high standards.
            </p>
            <p>
                Preventative Measures
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>
                We will not knowingly support or deal with any business involved in slavery or human trafficking in accordance with Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will ensure as far as practical that we take account of the threat of modern slavery and human trafficking in our recruitment process and appointment of staff. We aim to encourage openness and will support anyone who raises genuine concerns in good faith under this policy, even if they turn out to be mistaken. We are committed to ensuring no one suffers any detrimental treatment as a result of reporting in good faith their suspicion that modern slavery of whatever form is or may be taking place in any part of our own business or in any of our supply chains. Detrimental treatment includes dismissal, disciplinary action, threats or other unfavourable treatment connected with raising a concern.
            </p>

                <p>
                    Any member of staff found to be involved in modern slavery or human trafficking will be subject to disciplinary procedures.
                    All staff will be made aware of this policy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This policy will be reviewed and, if necessary, revised in light of legislative or organisational changes. Improvements will be made by learning from experience and the use of an established annual review.

                </p>
                <p>
                    1.1 The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_(European_Union)" target="blank" class="underline">regulation</a> by which the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament" target="blank" class="underline">European Parliament,</a>

                </p>
                <p>
                    1.2 The Regulations cover both written and computerised information and the individual’s right to see such records. It is important to note that the Regulations also cover records relating to staff and volunteers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1.3 The Regulations also cover personal information in relation to people who use our Services. Personal information is defined in GDPR as “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.
                </p>
                <p>

                    <li>
                        Erasure is necessary for compliance with EU law or the national law of the relevant Member State.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the event that any personal data that is to be erased in response to a data subject’s request has been disclosed to third parties, those parties shall be informed of the erasure (unless it is impossible or would require disproportionate effort to do so).
